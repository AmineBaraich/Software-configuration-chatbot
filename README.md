# AI-Powered risk Scenario Analysis Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **Flask** that allows users to simulate financial scenarios and perform **Monte Carlo simulations**. The chatbot uses a pre-trained NLP model from **Hugging Face's Transformers** to understand user input and respond accordingly, without the need for a database.

## Features
