# AI-Powered risk Scenario Analysis Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **Flask** that allows users to simulate financial scenarios and perform **Monte Carlo simulations**. The chatbot uses a pre-trained NLP model from **Hugging Face's Transformers** to understand user input and respond accordingly, without the need for a database.

## Features

- [Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/nlp/docs/pretrained_models.md)
- [Financial Scenario Simulations using Monte Carlo Methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-simulation-a-practical-guide-85da45597f0e)
- No Database Required Results are processed in-memory.
- Easily Extendable with More Advanced AI Models or simulation techniques.
